Simplify taxes management for products
======================================

Functionality:
--------------
    * Add a new light concept 'tax_group' to associate possible supplier"""
    """ and sale taxes;
    * Make more usable taxes selection in product view. The user has now the"""
    """ possibility to select a tax group, instead of select manually all"""
    """ the taxes;
    * Prevent users to select incompatible purchase and supplier taxes."""
    """ French Exemple: A product can not be configured with:
        * Supplier Taxes: 5.5 %;
        * Sale Taxes: 20%;
    * Provides the possibility to the account manager to change incorrect"""
    """ parameters massively;

Technical Information:
----------------------
    * Install this module will create 'tax_group' for each existing"""
    """ combination. Make sure that the user who install the module is"""
    """ SUPERUSER_ID or is member of account.group_account_manager;
    * In the same way, import products will create tax_group if combination"""
    """ doesn't exist and will fail if right access is not sufficient."""
    """ A solution is to provide tax_group_id during the import, instead of"""
    """ Providing taxes_id and purchase_taxes_id fields;
