This module adds a wizard to renumber account moves by date only for admin users.
=================================================================================

The wizard, that will be added to the "End of Year Treatments",
let's you select one or more journals and fiscal periods,
set a starting number; and then renumber all the posted moves
from those journals and periods sorted by date.

It will recreate the sequence number of each account move using their journal sequence so:
    - Sequences per journal are supported.
    - Sequences with prefixes and sufixes based on the move date are also supported.
