To use this module, you need to:

#. Be an accounting manager.
#. Go to *Accounting > Adviser > Renumber journal entries*.
#. Choose the *First number* of the journal entry that you want. It will be
   used to start numbering from there on.
#. Choose the *Starting date* and *Ending date*, to set when you want the
   process to begin and end.
#. Choose the journals where you want to perform the renumberings.
#. Press *Renumber*.

Now, the wizard will locate all journal entries found in those journals and
dates, and start numbering them without gaps in a sequential order that starts
with the *First number* you chose and matches the entry date order.

If no matches are found, you will be alerted. Otherwise, you will be redirected
to a view of all the entries that have been renumbered.
