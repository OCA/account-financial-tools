Description
===========

This module sets translate=True on account tax, journal, fiscal position name
and note fields and is intended for being used by multilingual accounting
localisation modules (e.g. l10n_be_coa_multilang in l10n-belgium).
Those data are displayed on invoice report.

Note that the l10n_account_translate module makes the account name field translatable (not visible on invoice report).
