Account chart reset
===================

Adds a method to the company to remove its chart of accounts, including all
related transactions, journals etc. By necessity, this process also removes
the company's bank accounts as they are linked to the company's journals and
the company's payment orders and payment modes if the payment module is
installed.

As a result, you can then reconfigure the company chart of account with the
same or a different chart template.
