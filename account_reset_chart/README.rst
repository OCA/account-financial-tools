Account chart reset
===================

Adds a method to the company to remove its chart of accounts, including all
related transactions, journals etc. By necessity, this process also removes
the company's bank accounts as they are linked to the company's journals and
the company's payment orders and payment modes if the payment module is
installed.

As a result, you can then reconfigure the company chart of account with the
same or a different chart template.

Usage
=====

To prevent major disasters when this module is installed, no interface is
provided. Please run through xmlrpc, for instance using erppeek: ::

    import erppeek
    
    host = 'localhost'
    port = '8069'
    admin_pw = 'admin'
    dbname = 'openerp'
    
    client = erppeek.Client('http://%s:%s' % (host, port))
    client.login('admin', admin_pw, dbname)
    client.execute('res.company', 'reset_chart', 1)

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

This should work with the standard accounting modules installed. All sorts of
combinations with third party modules are imaginable that would require
modifications or extensions of the current implementation.

Sequences are not reset during the process.
