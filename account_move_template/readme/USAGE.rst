To create new templates:

#. Make sure that you have flagged *Show Full Accounting Features* on your
   user, and that the user belongs to the *Billing Manager* group.
#. Go to *Invoicing / Configuration / Accounting / Journal Entry Templates* and
   define there your templates. You can choose to complete a line using a
   defined formula, based on other lines, or by requiring user input.

To use an existing template:

#. Go to *Invoicing / Accounting / Miscellaneous / Create Entry from Template*
#. Select one of the available templates.
#. As option, you can overwrite output lines with dict, i.e., {"L1": {"partner": 1}}
#. Complete the entries according to the template and click on the button *Generate Journal Entry*.
