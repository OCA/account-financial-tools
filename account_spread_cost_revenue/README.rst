Configuration
=============

To be able to access the full spreading features, the user must belong to *Show Full Accounting Features* group.

On the form view of the company, in the *Account Spread* tab, you can configure
the journals in which the spread journal items will be generated by default:

* the *Default Spread Journal for Revenues*,
* the *Default Spread Journal for Expenses*.

In the same *Account Spread* tab, you can also configure the Spread Balance Sheet Accounts used by default:

* the *Default Spread Account for Revenues*,
* the *Default Spread Account for Expenses*.

This module by default allows the spreading even before the receipt of the invoice or when the invoice is still draft,
so that it is possible to work on the plan of the cost/revenue spreading. To disable this feature, on the form view of
the company disable the *Allow Spread Planning* option.

In Spread Template, there is also option to *Auto assign template on invoice validate*, based on the preset invoice line criteria.

On the form view of the company, the *Auto-post spread lines* option forces the account moves created
during the cost/revenue spreading to be automatically posted. When this option is false, the user can
enable/disable the automatic posting by the flag *Auto-post lines* present in the spread board.

On the form view of the company, enable the *Auto-archive spread* option if you want the
cron job to automatically archive the spreads when all lines are posted.

Usage
=====

Define Spread Costs/Revenues Board

* *Debit Account*

* *Estimated Amount* (The total amount to spread)
* *Number of Repetitions*
* *Period Type* (Duration of each period)

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue/static/description/create_spread.png
   :alt: The spreading board is defined

A cron job will automatically create the accounting moves for all the lines having date previous that the current day (today).

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue/static/description/update_spread.png
   :alt: The spreading board is updated by the cron job

By default, the status of the created accounting moves is posted.
To disable the automatic posting of the accounting moves, set the flag *Auto-post lines* to False.
This flag is only available when the *Auto-post spread lines* option, present on the form view of the company, is disabled.

Click on button *Recalculate entire spread* button in the spread board to force the recalculation of the spread lines:
this will also reset all the journal entries previously created.

Link Invoice to Spread Costs/Revenues Board
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create an invoice or vendor bill in draft. On its lines, the spreading right-arrow icon are displayed in dark-grey color.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue/static/description/invoice_line_1.png
   :alt: On the invoice line the spreading icon is displayed

Click on the spreading right-arrow icon. A wizard prompts to enter a *Spread Action Type*:

- *Link to existing spread board*
- *Create from spread template*
- *Create new spread board*

Select *Link to existing spread board* and enter the previously generated Spread Board. Click on Confirm button:
the selected Spread Board will be automatically displayed.

Go back to the draft invoice/bill. The spreading functionality is now enabled on the invoice line:
the spreading right-arrow icon is now displayed in green color.

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_spread_cost_revenue/static/description/invoice_line_2.png
   :alt: On the invoice line the spreading icon is displayed in green color

Validate the invoice/bill. Click on the spreading (green) right-arrow icon to open the spread board, then click
on the smart button *Reconciled entries*: the moves of the spread lines are reconciled with the move of the invoice line.

In case the Subtotal Price of the invoice line is different than the *Estimated Amount* of the spread board, the spread
lines (not yet posted) will be recalculated when validating the invoice/bill.

Define Spread Costs/Revenues Template
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Under Invoicing -> Configuration -> Accounting -> Spread Templates, create a new spread template.

* *Spread Type*
* *Spread Balance Sheet Account*
* *Expense/Revenue Account* This option visible if invoice line account is balance sheet account, user need to specify this too.
* *Journal*
* *Auto assign template on invoice validate*

When creating a new Spread Costs/Revenues Board, select the right template.
This way the above fields will be copied to the Spread Board.

If *Auto assign template on invoice validate* is checked, this template will be used to auto create spread, if the underlining invoice match the preset product/account/analytic criteria.
