To be able to access the full spreading features, the user must belong to *Show Full Accounting Features* group.

On the form view of the company, in the *Account Spread* tab, you can configure
the journals in which the spread journal items will be generated by default:

* the *Default Spread Journal for Revenues*,
* the *Default Spread Journal for Expenses*.

In the same *Account Spread* tab, you can also configure the Spread Balance Sheet Accounts used by default:

* the *Default Spread Account for Revenues*,
* the *Default Spread Account for Expenses*.

This module by default allows the spreading even before the receipt of the invoice or when the invoice is still draft,
so that it is possible to work on the plan of the cost/revenue spreading. To disable this feature, on the form view of
the company disable the *Allow Spread Planning* option.

In Spread Template, there is also option to *Auto assign template on invoice validate*, based on the preset invoice line criteria.

On the form view of the company, the *Auto-post spread lines* option forces the account moves created
during the cost/revenue spreading to be automatically posted. When this option is false, the user can
enable/disable the automatic posting by the flag *Auto-post lines* present in the spread board.

On the form view of the company, enable the *Auto-archive spread* option if you want the
cron job to automatically archive the spreads when all lines are posted.
