To be able to access the full spreading features, the user must belong
to *Show Full Accounting Features* group.

On the form view of the company, in the *Account Spread* tab, you can
configure the journals in which the spread journal items will be
generated by default:

- the *Default Spread Journal for Revenues*,
- the *Default Spread Journal for Expenses*.

In the same *Account Spread* tab, you can also configure the Spread
Balance Sheet Accounts used by default:

- the *Default Spread Account for Revenues*,
- the *Default Spread Account for Expenses*.

This module by default allows the spreading even before the receipt of
the invoice or when the invoice is still draft, so that it is possible
to work on the plan of the cost/revenue spreading. To disable this
feature, on the form view of the company disable the *Allow Spread
Planning* option.

In Spread Template, there is also option to *Auto assign template on
invoice validate*, based on the preset invoice line criteria.

On the form view of the company, the *Auto-post spread lines* option
forces the account moves created during the cost/revenue spreading to be
automatically posted. When this option is false, the user can
enable/disable the automatic posting by the flag *Auto-post lines*
present in the spread board.

On the form view of the company, enable the *Auto-archive spread* option
if you want the cron job to automatically archive the spreads when all
lines are posted.
