This module allows to set up an account in tax repartition lines
based on a default account set up in the tax group.

Some countries like the US use tax integrations such as Tax Cloud, Tax Jar, etc..
that create taxes as a result of an API call to those applications. In those
cases a default account for tax should be proposed for those new taxes.
