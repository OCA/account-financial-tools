This module allows to set up an account in tax repartition lines based
on a default account set up in the tax group.

Some countries like the US use tax integrations such as Tax Cloud, Tax
Jar, etc.. that create taxes as a result of an API call to those
applications. In those cases a default account for tax should be
proposed for those new taxes.
