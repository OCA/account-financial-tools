This module allows to set up an account in tax repartition lines based
on a default account set up in the tax group.

Some countries like the US use tax integrations such as Tax Cloud, Tax
Jar, etc.. that create taxes as a result of an API call to those
applications. In those cases a default account for tax should be
proposed for those new taxes.

Configuration
=============

Go to the tax group and change the field 'Default account to use in
repartition lines'.

Usage
=====

1. Go to *Invocing/Accounting > Configuration > Taxes*
2. Create a new tax and make sure that it references the tax group that
   you have configured with a default account.
3. Upon saving the tax you should see a tax being populated in the
   sections 'Repartition for invoices' and 'Repartition for credit
   notes'.
