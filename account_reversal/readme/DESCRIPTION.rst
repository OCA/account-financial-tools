This module improves the current Odoo implementation of accounting entries
reversal process by:

* adding a checkbox and filter "to be reversed" on account moves,
* allowing to add a reversal reason on journal items (the reason on journal entry
  already exists in core),
* making the reversal reason field visible when reversing all types of entries.
