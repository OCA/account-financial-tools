Menu entries are located in ``Invoicing > Adviser > Credit Control``.

Create a new "run" in the ``Credit Control Run`` menu with the controlling date.
Then, use the ``Compute Credit Lines`` button. All the credit control lines will
be generated. You can find them in the ``Credit Control Lines`` menu.

On each generated line, you have many choices:
 * Send a email
 * Print a letter
 * Change the state (so you can ignore or reopen lines)
 * Mark a line as Manually Overridden. The line will get the ignored state when
   a second credit control run is done.
 * Mark one line as Manual followup will also mark all the lines of the
   partner. The partner will be visible in "Do Manual Follow-ups".
