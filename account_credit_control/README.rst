Credit Control
==============

Configuration
-------------

Configure the policies and policy levels in ``Accounting  > Configuration >
Credit Control > Credit Policies``.
You can define as many policy levels as you need.

Configure a tolerance for the Credit control and a default policy
applied on all partners in each company, under the Accounting tab.

You are able to specify a particular policy for one partner or one invoice.

Usage
-----

Menu entries are located in ``Accounting > Periodical Processing > Credit
Control``.

Create a new "run" in the ``Credit Control Run`` menu with the controlling date.
Then, use the ``Compute credit lines`` button. All the credit control lines will
be generated. You can find them in the ``Credit Control Lines`` menu.

On each generated line, you have many choices:
 * Send a email
 * Print a letter
 * Change the state (so you can ignore or reopen lines)
