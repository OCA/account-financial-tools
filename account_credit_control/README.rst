Configuration
=============

Configure the policies and policy levels in ``Invoicing  > Configuration >
Credit Control > Credit Control Policies``.
You can define as many policy levels as you need. You must set on which
accounts are applied every Credit Control Policy under Accounts tab.

Configure a tolerance for the Credit control and a default policy
applied on all partners in each company, under the Accounting tab in your
company form.

You are able to specify a particular policy for one partner or one invoice.

Usage
=====

Menu entries are located in ``Invoicing > Adviser > Credit Control``.

Create a new "run" in the ``Credit Control Run`` menu with the controlling date.
Then, use the ``Compute Credit Lines`` button. All the credit control lines will
be generated. You can find them in the ``Credit Control Lines`` menu.

On each generated line, you have many choices:
 * Send a email
 * Print a letter
 * Change the state (so you can ignore or reopen lines)
 * Mark a line as Manually Overridden. The line will get the ignored state when
   a second credit control run is done.
 * Mark one line as Manual followup will also mark all the lines of the
   partner. The partner will be visible in "Do Manual Follow-ups".
