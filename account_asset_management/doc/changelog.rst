`V2.0`

Enhancements/changes made by Noviat (www.noviat.com)

- New Time Method: Number of Years

- New Computation Method: Degressive-Linear

- Fiscal Year based depreciation table calculation.

   The table calculation logic has been rewritten:
   - The calculation takes into account fiscal year start/stop dates.
     Fiscal year start/stop dates can be different from calendar year start/stop dates.
     Also extended/shortened fiscal years are supported.
   - The first entry will contain the Year-To-Date depreciation amount.
   - The depreciation table is calculated in 2 steps:
     - Step 1: calculate the amount for the fiscal years.
     - Step 2: spread this amount over the fiscal year according to the selected depreciation period duration.
   - Rounding deviations caused by the cost spreading over the fiscal are compensated as follows:
     - year 1: compensation on the first depreciation date
     - others years: compensation on the last depreciation date of the fiscal year.
   - Fiscal year dates and duration are not known yet at the time of asset creation.
     The initial depreciation table calculation assumes undefined fiscal years to be equal to a calendar year.
     Fiscal year duration changes are automatically taken into account by recomputing the depreciation table when running the periodical asset posting wizard.
   - Depreciation dates are always equal to the last date of a Fiscal Year/Quarter/Month.

- Time Methods

   The Time Method 'Number of Years' should be used for Financial Assets.
   
   The Time Methods 'Ending Date' and 'Number of Depreciations' have been adapted for Deferred Cost/Income and Cost/Income Spreading purposes.
   As a consequence, the calculation is always 'pro rata' for these Time Methods and the 'Set to Removed' button is not available. 

- Accounting entry corrections
   Negative depreciation amounts are correctly handled (e.g. to compensate for excessive depreciation in case of period duration change).

- Foreign currency support

   Purchases in foreign currency are converted to company currency using the exchange rate at the purchase date.
   The depreciation table is calculated in company currency. 

- The 'Journal Entries' button now opens a list view of the 'Journal Entries'. 

   The 'Journal Items' remain available via the 'Journal Items' link and the History tab.

- An extra button is added to the depreciation lines to facilitate the access to the accounting entry associated with a depreciation line.

- The Accounting Entry Reference field can be customised via the '_get_depreciation_entry_name' method.

- account.asset.asset,purchase_date (Purchase Date) field renamed to date_start (Depreciation Start Date), since an asset can be composed of different purchases.

- Assets with accounting entries in previous/closed fy's/periods are supported via 'Initial Balance Entries' in the depreciation table.

- Extra controls have been added to guarantee consistency between depreciation lines amounts and accounting entry values:
    - an accounting entry linked to an asset cannot be changed
    - an asset_id cannot be added to an accounting entry
    - a depreciation line with a linked accounting entry cannot be changed
   

- Depreciation line 'sequence' field removed (replaced by m2o to previous line)

- Database fields replaced by computed fields:
    - account.asset.asset : asset_value
    - account.asset.depreciation.line :  remaining_value, depreciated_value

- parent_id concept has been changed : parent = type 'view'|'normal'. Hierarchy view shows subtotal calculation.

- new (calculated) asset field 'value_depreciated', UI (form, list, hierarchy) adapted to show fields value, depreciated, remaining

- new field on account.account : asset_category_id used as default asset category on sale invoice invoice line with asset account

- Support the Purchase Journal 'Group Invoice Lines' option

- account.asset.depreciation.line renamed to account.asset.line with types 'create'|'depreciate'|'dispose' since this table is now used to track the complete lifecycle of an asset.

- 'Remove' button to generate the asset removal accounting moves.

- Extra security
    - 'Set to Draft' button reserved for users of the 'Accounting & Finance / Manager' group.
    - 'Asset Removal' button reserved for users of the 'Accounting & Finance / Manager' group.
    - 'Remove accounting entry' button reserved for users of the 'Accounting & Finance / Manager' group.

- Fixes for Time Methods 'Number of Depreciations' and 'Ending Date'
    - Pro Rata Temporis: include asset start date in number of days for first depreciation
    - Fix logic for recompute of table with posted entries
    - Fix rounding errors in depreciation table computation

- Selection lists for fields 'method' and 'method_time' have been moved to object methods so that they can be modified in an inherited module.

- Migration code has been added to upgrade asset database tables via the standard module upgrade process.
