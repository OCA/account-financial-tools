This Module manages the assets owned by a company. It will keep
track of depreciation's occurred on those assets. And it allows to create
accounting entries from the depreciation lines.

The full asset life-cycle is managed (from asset creation to asset removal).

Assets can be created manually as well as automatically
(via the creation of an accounting entry on the asset account).

The module contains a large number of functional enhancements compared to
the standard account_asset module from Odoo.
