This module adds an option *Partner policy* on account types.

You have the choice between 3 policies:

- *optional* (the default policy): partner is optional,
- *always*: require a partner,
- *never*: forbid a partner.

This module is useful to enforce a partner on account move lines on
customer and supplier accounts.

This module is very similar to the module *account_analytic_required*
available in the OCA project
[account-analytic](https://github.com/OCA/account-analytic).
