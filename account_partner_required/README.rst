========================
Account Partner Required
========================

This module adds an option *Partner policy* on account types.

You have the choice between 3 policies:

* *optional* (the default policy): partner is optional,
* *always*: require a partner,
* *never*: forbid a partner.

This module is useful to enforce a partner on account move lines on
customer and supplier accounts.

This module is very similar to the module *account_analytic_required* available in the OCA project `account-analytic <https://github.com/OCA/account-analytic>`_.

Configuration
=============

Go to the menu *Accounting > Configuration > Accounting > Account Types* and edit each account types to configure the correct *Partner policy*.

Usage
=====

If you put a partner on an account move line with an account whose type is configured with *Partner policy* = *never*, you will get an error message.

If you don't put a partner on an account move line with an account whose type is configured with *Partner policy* = *always*, you will get an error message.
