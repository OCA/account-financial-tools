This module adds an option *Partner policy* on account types.

You have the choice between 3 policies:

-  *optional* (the default policy): partner is optional,
-  *always*: require a partner,
-  *never*: forbid a partner.

This module is useful to enforce a partner on account move lines on
customer and supplier accounts.

This module is very similar to the module *account_analytic_required*
available in the OCA project
`account-analytic <https://github.com/OCA/account-analytic>`__.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

1. Go to the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Chart of
   Accounts* and edit each account to configure the correct *Partner
   policy*.

Usage
=====

If you put a partner on an account move line with an account whose type
is configured with *Partner policy* = *never*, you will get an error
message.

If you don't put a partner on an account move line with an account whose
type is configured with *Partner policy* = *always*, you will get an
error message.
