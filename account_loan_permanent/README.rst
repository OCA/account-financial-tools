Usage
=====

To use this module for permanent loans, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to Invoicing / Accounting > Accounting > Loans.
2. Create a new loan or edit an existing one.
3. Configure the loan by setting the following fields:

   - Company
   - Loan Type: Select "Only interest" for permanent loans
   - Amount
   - Rate
   - Accounts
   - Check the "Is Permanent" checkbox

4. Post the loan. This will automatically create an account move with
   the expected amounts.

For permanent loans: - The system will automatically generate new loan
lines to maintain the minimum number of future periods. - Only interest
will be settled, and the principal amount remains constant. - The loan
will continue indefinitely until manually closed or modified.

Additional features: - Generate loan entries: The system can
automatically create account moves for unfinished loans up to a
specified date. - Modify rates: You can adjust rates for unposted lines
if needed. - Extend loan duration: The system will automatically add new
periods to maintain the minimum number of future periods.

Note: Permanent loans can only be of type "Only interest". Attempting to
set a loan as permanent with a different type will result in a warning
message.
