Account Constraints Banking
===========================

This is a glue module between account_constraints and account_banking.

account_constraints prevents unlinking (or even changing) moves that are
linked to a bank statement, directing the user to instead apply changes
on the bank statement directly. Without this module changes on the
bank statement, like cancelling a transaction, are also prevented.
