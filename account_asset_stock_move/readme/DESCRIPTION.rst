By standard, asset is created when vendor bill is confirmed (asset profile was set on invoice line)

But in case real time stock is used, account moves created on stock moves, and it is possible to create asset on confirm of stock picking.

This should be useful for organization that want to create asset during stock in and not when confirm vendor bill.
