This module will be very useful for those who are still using v7/v8 because of the no parent account 
and chart of account heirarchy view in the latest versions

        * Adds parent account in account
        * Adds new type 'view' in account type
        * Adds Chart of account heirachy view
        * Adds credit, debit and balance in account
        * Shows chart of account based on the date and target moves we have selected

    - Need to set the group show chart of account structure to view the chart of account heirarchy.
    - If no parent account is set, then just a list view with credit,debit, balance will be showed
    
    Contact us for any need of customisation or chart of account migration from v7/v8 - v9/v10
