This module allows to reorganize customers debts in case of difficult financial conditions in order to spread the debts over a longer period of time.
The module can also be used in a similar way for the user's company in case their suppliers offer them the opportunity to discuss a clearance plan.

One can decide the debts to be part of the clearance plan (all partner's debts or some of them only) and split this amount into new financial commitments at new dates.
Please notice that one clearance plan = one payable/receivable account.
