This module extends the functionality of Accounting Odoo module, to
generate custom sub sequences for accounting entries, if fiscal years are not "classic".
(ie: last day = 31 / last month = 12)

without this module, in such cases (for example, for fiscal year from 01 April 2020 to 31 May 2021)
accounting moves of the same fiscal year will not have the same numbering: Some entries will
have ``BILL/2020/`` prefix and other will have ``BILL/2021/``, that is not allowed in many countries.

That modules fixes this problem.

Configuration
=============

To configure this module, you need to:

* Add your users to the group 'Technical Settings / Show Full Accounting Features'

* Go to Invoicing > Configuration / Settings

* configure your accounting settings

.. figure:: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OCA/account-financial-tools/12.0/account_subsequence_fiscal_year/static/description/res_config_setting.png

Depending on what you want, 3 options are available.

Given the following example:

- an account move with a date set to 2030-06-01
- a company set with ``fiscalyear_last_day = 1`` and ``fiscalyear_last_month = 10``

* 'empty' (default value):
  the subsequence will be created "normaly", with ``date_from = 2030-01-01`` and ``date_to = 2030-12-31``

* 'Based on Company Settings':
  the subsequence will be created depending on the values of ``fiscalyear_last_day``
  and ``fiscalyear_last_month``, so ``date_from = 2029-10-01`` and ``date_to = 2030-09-30``

* 'Based on Fiscal Years Settings':
  the subsequence will be created with the values defined in the according fiscal year.
  Note that if no fiscal year is found, the generation will fail.
