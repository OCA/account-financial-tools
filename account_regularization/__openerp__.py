    This module creates a new object in accounting,
    very similar to the account models named account.regularization.
    Within this object you can define regularization moves,
    This is, accounting moves that will automatically calculate
    the balance of a set of accounts,set it to 0 and
    transfer the difference to a new account. This is used,
    for example with tax declarations or in some countries to create
    the 'Profit and Loss' regularization
