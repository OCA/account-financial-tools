Let the generated move in draft on invoice and bank statement
validation. The main reason is to ease the user's day-to-day work. At
first we used account_cancel, but this module allow to cancel posted
move and that's not allowed.

Two needs here:

- We want to be able to cancel an invoice (as soon as move are not
  validated) without making a refund. Posted move can't be
  canceled.

- We want to ensure all moves generated from bank statements and
  invoices are generated in draft state so we can still change them if
  needed.

Use this module with account_constraints
(https://launchpad.net/account-financial-tools or in http://apps.openerp.com)
and you'll get closely the same feature as account_cancel, but with the
insurance that user won't change posted move.

The new framework will then be: always work with draft moves,
allowing people to change what they want. At the end of the
period, validate all moves. Until then, you ensure no-one can
change something (or they'll need to make a refund).
