Let the generated move in draft on invoice and bank statement
validation. The main reason is to ease the user work day-to-day. At
first we used account_cancel, but this module allow to cancel posted
move and that's not allowed.

Two needs here:

- We want to be able to cancel an invoice (as soon as move are not
  validated) without making a refund. Posted move can't be canceled.
- We want to ensure all move generated from bank statement and invoice
  are generated in draft so we can still change them if needed.

Use this module with account_constraints (find it here:
https://launchpad.net/account-financial-tools or in
http://apps.openerp.com) and you'll get closely the same feature as
account_cancel, but with the insurance that user won't change posted
move.

The new framework will then be: always work with draft moves, allowing
people to change what they want. At the end of the period, validate all
moves. Till there, you ensure no-one can change something (or they'll
need to make a refund).
