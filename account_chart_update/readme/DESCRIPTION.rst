This is a pretty useful tool to update Odoo installations after tax reforms
on the official charts of accounts, or to apply fixes performed on the chart
template.

The wizard:

* Allows the user to compare a chart and a template showing differences
  on accounts, taxes, tax codes and fiscal positions.
* It may create the new account, taxes, tax codes and fiscal positions detected
  on the template.
* It can also update (overwrite) the accounts, taxes, tax codes and fiscal
  positions that got modified on the template.
