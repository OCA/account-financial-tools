The wizard, accesible from *Accounting > Settings > Update Chart Template*,
lets the user select what kind of objects must be checked/updated, and whether
old records must be checked for changes and updates.

It will display all the objects to be created / updated / deactivated with some
information about the detected differences, and allow the user to exclude
records individually.
