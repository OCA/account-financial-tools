This is a pretty useful tool to update Odoo installations after tax reforms
on the official charts of accounts, or to apply fixes performed on the chart
template.

The wizard:

* Allows the user to compare a chart and a template showing differences
  on accounts, taxes, tax codes and fiscal positions.
* It may create the new account, taxes, tax codes and fiscal positions detected
  on the template.
* It can also update (overwrite) the accounts, taxes, tax codes and fiscal
  positions that got modified on the template.

Usage
=====

The wizard, accesible from *Accounting > Settings > Update Chart Template*,
lets the user select what kind of objects must be checked/updated, and whether
old records must be checked for changes and updates.

It will display all the objects to be created / updated / deactivated with some
information about the detected differences, and allow the user to exclude
records individually.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

* Generate and update account reconcile models.
* Generate XML-ID for fiscal position tax and account mapping lines.
* Allow to select independently operations to perform (create, update,
  deactivate).
* Detect fiscal positions to deactivate?
