===========================================================
Detect changes and update the Account Chart from a template
===========================================================

This is a pretty useful tool to update Odoo installations after tax reforms
on the official charts of accounts, or to apply fixes performed on the chart
template.

The wizard:

* Allows the user to compare a chart and a template showing differences
  on accounts, taxes, tax codes and fiscal positions.
* It may create the new account, taxes, tax codes and fiscal positions detected
  on the template.
* It can also update (overwrite) the accounts, taxes, tax codes and fiscal
  positions that got modified on the template.

Usage
=====

The wizard, accesible from *Accounting > Configuration > Settings > Chart of
Accounts > Update chart of accounts*, lets the user select what kind of objects
must be checked/updated, and whether old records must be checked for changes
and updates.

It will display all the objects to be created / updated with some information
about the detected differences, and allow the user to exclude records
individually.
