This module allows you to easily manage check deposits: you can select
all the checks you received and create a global deposit for the selected
checks. This module supports multi-currency ; each deposit has a
currency and all the checks of the deposit must have the same currency
(so, if you have checks in EUR and checks in USD, you must create 2
deposits: one in EUR and one in USD).

Configuration
=============

In the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Journals*, create
a new journal:

-  Name: Checks Received
-  Type: Bank
-  Short Code: CHK (or any code you want)
-  in the tab *Incoming Payments*, add a line with *Payment Method* =
   *Manual* and *Outstanding receipts account* set to the account for
   the checks in hand.

Note that, on this *Checks Received* journal, the bank account and
suspense account will not be used, so don't worry about these
parameters. The field *Account number* must be empty.

This bank journal will be available as a payment method in Odoo. The
account you configured as *Outstanding Receipts Account* is the account
via which the amounts of checks will transit between the reception of a
check from a customer and the validation of the check deposit in Odoo.

When you validate the check deposit in Odoo, it will generate a new
journal entry that will move the amounts from the *Outstanding Receipts
Account* of the checks received journal to the *Outstanding Receipts
Account* of the bank journal related to the check deposit. It will also
reconcile in the *Outstanding Receipts Account* of the checks received
journal.

Usage
=====

When you receive a check that pays a customer invoice, you can go to
that invoice and click on the button *Register Payment* and select the
*Checks Received* journal as *Journal*.

When you want to deposit checks to the bank, go to the menu *Invoicing >
Customers > Checks Deposits*, create a new check deposit and set the
journal *Checks Received* and select the bank account on which you want
to credit the checks.

Then click on the button *Get All Received Checks* if you want to
deposit all the waiting received checks, or select the checks one by one
by clicking on *Add a line*.

Eventually, validate the deposit and print the report (you probably want
to customize this report).
