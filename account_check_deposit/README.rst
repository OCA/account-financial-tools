=============
Check Deposit
=============

This module allows you to easily manage check deposits : you can select all
the checks you received and create a global deposit for the
selected checks. This module supports multi-currency ; each deposit has a currency
and all the checks of the deposit must have the same currency
(so, if you have checks in EUR and checks in USD, you must create 2 deposits :
one in EUR and one in USD).

Configuration
=============

A journal named *Check Received* is automatically created. It will be available as a payment method in Odoo. On this journal, you must configure the *Default Debit Account* and *Defaut Credit Account* ; this is the account via which the amounts of checks will transit between the reception of a check from a customer and the validation of the check deposit in Odoo.

On the company form view, you should configure the *Account for Check Deposits* ; this is the account via which the amounts of checks will transit between the validation of the check deposit in Odoo and the credit on the bank account.

Usage
=====

When you receive a check that pays a customer invoice, you can go to that invoice and click on the button *Register Payment* and select the *Check Received* journal as *Payment Method*.

When you want to deposit checks to the bank, go to the menu *Accounting > Bank and Cash > Check Deposit*, create a new check deposit and set the journal *Checks Received* and select the bank account on which you want to credit the checks. Then click on *Add an item* to select the checks you want to deposit at the bank. Eventually, validate the deposit and print the report (you probably want to customize this report).
