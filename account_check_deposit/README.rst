This module allows you to easily manage check deposits: you can select all
the checks you received and create a global deposit for the selected checks.
This module supports multi-currency ; each deposit has a currency and all the
checks of the deposit must have the same currency (so, if you have checks in
EUR and checks in USD, you must create 2 deposits: one in EUR and one in USD).

Configuration
=============

In the menu *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Journals*, create a new
journal:

* Name: Checks Received
* Type: Bank
* Short Code: CHK (or any code you want)
* Outstanding Receipts Account: select an account for checks received

Note that, on this *Checks Received* journal, the bank account and suspense account will not be used, so don't worry about these parameters.

This bank journal will be available as a payment method in Odoo. The account
you configured as *Outstanding Receipts Account* is the
account via which the amounts of checks will transit between the reception of a
check from a customer and the validation of the check deposit in Odoo.

When you validate the check deposit in Odoo, it will generate a new journal entry that will move the amounts from the *Outstanding Receipts Account* of the checks received journal to the *Outstanding Receipts Account* of the bank journal related to the check deposit. It will also reconcile in the *Outstanding Receipts Account* of the checks received journal.

Usage
=====

When you receive a check that pays a customer invoice, you can go to that
invoice and click on the button *Register Payment* and select the
*Checks Received* journal as *Journal*.

When you want to deposit checks to the bank, go to the menu
*Invoicing > Accounting > Miscellaneous > Check Deposit*, create a new check deposit and set the
journal *Checks Received* and select the bank account on which you want to
credit the checks.

Then click on the button *Get All Received Checks* if you want to deposit all the waiting received checks, or select the checks one by one by clicking on *Add a line*.

Eventually, validate the deposit and print the report (you probably want to customize this report).
