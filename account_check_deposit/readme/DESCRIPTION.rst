This module allows you to easily manage check deposits: you can select all
the checks you received and create a global deposit for the selected checks.
This module supports multi-currency ; each deposit has a currency and all the
checks of the deposit must have the same currency (so, if you have checks in
EUR and checks in USD, you must create 2 deposits: one in EUR and one in USD).
