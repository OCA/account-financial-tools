This module enables by default the setting *Lock Posted Entries with
Hash* in all Journals and prevents the setting to be modified.

The goal is to assure that all journal entries are locked when posted to
prevent them to be modified.

Known issues / Roadmap
======================

-  Odoo hides the setting *Lock Posted Entries with Hash* on Bank and
   Cash Journals, but enabling it does not cause issues in the
   reconciliation for now. If the Odoo logic changes at any point, the
   module may need to be adapted to only force the setting on other
   types of journals.
