Usage
=====

To utilize the `account_asset_management_fleet` module and associate a vehicle with an asset, follow these steps:

1. Enter Purchase Invoice:
   Enter the purchase invoice for a new asset. Include the vehicle information in the invoice line by selecting the corresponding field for the vehicle associated with the asset.

2. Associate Vehicles Automatically:
   When entering the purchase invoice with the vehicle information in the corresponding line, the system automatically associates this vehicle with the asset during its creation. Simplify the process by eliminating the need to manually associate the vehicle with the asset later.

3. Associate Vehicles Manually:
   If preferred or in situations where it's not feasible to provide the vehicle information in the invoice line, manually associate the vehicle directly in the asset's record. Access the asset record and select the corresponding vehicle in the editing interface.

Follow these steps to easily associate vehicles with assets in the system, enabling integrated and efficient resource management.
