======================
Account asset disposal
======================

This module extends the functionality of account_asset and automatically
generates the asset close move

Usage
=====

When an asset is broken or is totally depreciated you can close it and Odoo
will generate automacally the asset close move (and compute the loss if a residual
value is pending)

In asset you will find a 'Disposal' button (instead of standard 'Set to Close').
After click, a wizard pops-up for asking disposal date and loss account to use
if any residual value is pending.
