#. Go to *Accounting > Adviser > Assets*.
#. There you will find a 'Dispose' button (instead of standard 'Set to Close').
#. After clicking it, a wizard pops-up for asking disposal date and loss
   account to use if any residual value is pending.
#. Click on "Dispose asset".
#. A new screen will appear with the disposal account entry.
#. On the asset, all remaining depreciation lines are removed, and a new one
   appears for the disposal move.

You can cancel afterwards the disposal:

#. Click on "Undo disposal" on the asset.
#. The disposal entry is removed.
#. The depreciation board is restored with all the remaining depreciations.
