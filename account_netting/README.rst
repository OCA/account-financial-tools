This module allows to compensate the balance of a receivable account with the
balance of a payable account for the same partner, creating a journal item
that reflects this operation.

**WARNING**: This operation can be forbidden in your country by the accounting
regulations, so you should check current laws before using it. For example, in
Spain, this is not allowed at first instance, unless you document well the
operation from both parties.

Usage
=====

From any account journal entries view:

* Accounting/Journal Entries/Journal Items

select all the lines that corresponds to both AR/AP operations from the same
partner. Click on *Action > Compensate*. If the items don't correspond to the
same partner or they aren't AR/AP accounts, you will get an error.

On contrary, a dialog box will be presented with the result of the operation
and a selection of the journal to register the operation. When you click on the
*Compensate* button, a journal entry is created with the corresponding
counterparts of the AR/AP operations.
