This module allows to compensate the balance of a receivable account with the
balance of a payable account for the same partner, creating a journal item
that reflects this operation.

**WARNING**: This operation can be forbidden in your country by the accounting
regulations, so you should check current laws before using it. For example, in
Spain, this is not allowed at first instance, unless you document well the
operation from both parties.
