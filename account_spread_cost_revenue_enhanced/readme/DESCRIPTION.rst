This module aim to address more business cases by adding extra technical function.

1. Add action to direct link with journal item (account.move.line) from spread cost/revenue sheet.
    This is useful when user want to link spread cost/revenue sheet with journal entry (not with invoice)
2. From spread cost/revenue sheet, allow Create Entry as Invoice (not just entry)

Note: extra feature in this module is not included in account_spread_cost_revenue to avoid complexity.
