This module adds a Preview column in the Journal Items list (account_move_line).
On the Preview column, the link to the attachment (file) is shown, if file is present.
Click on the link to preview the attachment of the invoice/vendor bill.

On a large monitor, when the preview is opened, the attachment is displayed on the right side.
When the preview is opened on a smaller display, the attachment is opened on a new browser tab.
