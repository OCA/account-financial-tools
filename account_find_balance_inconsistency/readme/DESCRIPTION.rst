This module helps you find inconsistencies in your balance sheet.

It will generate (by default) the asset and liability reports for a given
period, and stop at the first date those two yield different results. Then
it takes the user to the accounting items from this day, where corrective
action can be taken. When done, the wizard can be restarted until all issues
are resolved.
