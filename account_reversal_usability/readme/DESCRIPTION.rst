This module purpose is to improve the usability of the move line reverse functionality by adding:

* a field that allows tagging a move line as needing to be reversed. The value of the field gets automatically set to False once a reversed entry is made.
* a filter in the search view that allows selecting the moves that are flagged as needing to be reversed.
* the reverse move in the form view
