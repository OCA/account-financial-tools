This module extends the functionality of account to support sequenced entry
numbers and to allow you to renumber them if needed, on demand.

It adds a new field called *Entry number*. This is independent from the *Number*
that Odoo adds by default, and has different purpose.

Installation
============

After installing this module, no entry numbers will be generated because that
could have a very negative impact in installations that already had a lot of
account moves.

If you need to add numbers to preexisting account moves, please use the
renumbering wizard as explained in the *Usage* section.

Configuration
=============

To configure journal sequences:

#. Have full accounting permissions.
#. Go to *Invoicing > Configuration > Accounting > Journals*.
#. Select or create the journal you want to configure.
#. Use *Account entry number sequence* to configure a sequence.

Note that:

* Various journals can share the same sequence.
* All journals get a shared default sequence, per company.
* Entry numbers must be unique per company. So, if you use different sequences
  per journal, make sure they don't produce colliding results.

Usage
=====

To see journal entry numbers:

#. Go to *Invoicing > Accounting > Miscellaneous > Journal Entries*.
#. Notice the new field *Entry Number*. Only posted moves get an entry number.

Note that:

* You can use that new field in quick searches.
* You can see it also in *Invoicing > Accounting > Miscellaneous > Journal Items*.

To renumber journal entries:

#. Have full accounting permissions.
#. Have *Accounting / Invoicing / Billing Administrator* permissions.
#. Go to *Invoicing > Accounting > Actions > Renumber journal entries*.
#. Configure those parameters.
#. Click on *Renumber*.

Note that:

* You will only be able to select sequences related to journals.
* A sequence usually affects various journals, if not all.
