When you receive a check, cash or transfer that pays a customer invoice,

go to the menu *Invoicing > Accounting > Bank Receipt*,
create a new bank receipt and set the journal *Bank Intransit*
and select the bank account on which you want to receive.
Then click on *Add a line* to select the payment you want to
deposit at the bank and select type of payment and allocation.
Eventually, validate the deposit.
