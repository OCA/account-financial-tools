This module will allow to bypass the protection on draft mode button
visibility on account moves.

This will not show the draft button in case of hash integrity
restriction.

Use Cases / Context
===================

In some situations, people needs to change non critical information that
are not editable if the account move is not draft.

If stock_account module is installed and stock valuation layers have
been generated, Odoo does not allow to come back to draft.

The solution provided here would allow to get back to draft mode, log
the information and warn the user about the implications.

Configuration
=============

-  In Settings > Users & Companies > Users
-  Choose a user
-  In Access Rights > Technical
-  Check the 'Account Moves - Show Draft Button' box in 'Access Rights'
