the spreading right-arrow icon is now displayed in green color.

When generating an invoice from the contract, the spread table will be automatically created
and linked to the respective invoice line.
The spread date is the date from the next invoice date present in the contract.
The period of the contract is copied to the spread. So if the contract is 3 months, it will also set
the spread period to 3x1 months.
