Configuration
=============

Under Invoicing -> Configuration -> Accounting -> Spread Templates, create a new spread template.

* *Spread Type*
* *Spread Balance Sheet Account*
* *Journal*

Usage
=====

Create a contract that will generate recurring invoices.
On its lines, the spreading right-arrow icon are displayed in dark-grey color.

Click on the spreading right-arrow icon. A wizard prompts to enter a *Spread Template*.

Click on Confirm button: the selected Spread Template will be automatically displayed.

Go back to the contract. The spreading functionality is now enabled on the contract line:
the spreading right-arrow icon is now displayed in green color.

When generating an invoice from the contract, the spread table will be automatically created
and linked to the respective invoice line.
The spread date is the date from the next invoice date present in the contract.
The period of the contract is copied to the spread. So if the contract is 3 months, it will also set
the spread period to 3x1 months.
