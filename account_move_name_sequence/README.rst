In Odoo version 13.0 and previous versions, the number of journal
entries was generated from a sequence configured on the journal.

In Odoo version 14.0, the number of journal entries can be manually set
by the user. Then, the number attributed for the next journal entries in
the same journal is computed by a complex piece of code that guesses the
format of the journal entry number from the number of the journal entry
which was manually entered by the user. It has several drawbacks:

-  the available options for the sequence are limited,
-  it is not possible to configure the sequence in advance before the
   deployment in production,
-  as it is error-prone, they added a *Resequence* wizard to re-generate
   the journal entry numbers, which can be considered as illegal in many
   countries,
-  the `piece of
   code <https://github.com/odoo/odoo/blob/14.0/addons/account/models/sequence_mixin.py>`__
   that handles this is not easy to understand and quite difficult to
   debug.

Using this module, you can configure what kind of documents the gap
sequence may be relaxed And even if you must use no-gap in your company
or country it will reduce the concurrency issues since the module is
using an extra table (ir_sequence) instead of locking the last record

For those like me who think that the implementation before Odoo v14.0
was much better, for the accountants who think it should not be possible
to manually enter the sequence of a customer invoice, for the auditor
who considers that resequencing journal entries is prohibited by law,
this module may be a solution to get out of the nightmare.

The field names used in this module to configure the sequence on the
journal are exactly the same as in Odoo version 13.0 and previous
versions. That way, if you migrate to Odoo version 14.0 and you install
this module immediately after the migration, you should keep the
previous behavior and the same sequences will continue to be used.

The module removes access to the *Resequence* wizard on journal entries.

Configuration
=============

On the form view of an account journal, in the first tab, there is a
many2one link to the sequence. When you create a new journal, you can
keep this field empty and a new sequence will be automatically created
when you save the journal.

On sale and purchase journals, you have an additional option to have
another sequence dedicated to refunds.

Upon module installation, all existing journals will be updated with a
journal entry sequence (and also a credit note sequence for sale and
purchase journals). You should update the configuration of the sequences
to fit your needs. You can uncheck the option *Dedicated Credit Note
Sequence* on existing sale and purchase journals if you don't want it.
For the journals which already have journal entries, you should update
the sequence configuration to avoid a discontinuity in the numbering for
the next journal entry.
