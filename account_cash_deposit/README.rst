This module adds support for **cash deposits at the bank**. It also supports the other way around: **ordering cash at the bank**. It allows to declare the kind of cash you want to deposit (or order): bank notes, coins and coin rolls and the quantity for each of them. Coins are rarely used, because most banks only allow to deposit/order coin rolls.

Configuration
=============

First, for each currency of your cash boxes, you must define the bank notes and coin rolls for that currency (coin rolls are often standardised by the Central Bank). You can also definie the coins, but it's not useful if your bank only accept coin rolls and not coins.

To save time for new users, this module provides the bank notes, coins and coin rolls for several currencies (EUR, USD, CAD, etc.). If it is not the case for your currency, it would be very nice of you to contribute it (you can use the file *account_cash_deposit/data/cash_unit_eur.xml* as an example).

To save time when encoding the cash deposits/orders, you can set the parameter *Auto Create* on the bank notes and/or coin rolls that you use very often.

On the Accounting configuration page, in the section *Bank & Cash*, the *Inter-Banks Transfer Account* must be configured.

Usage
=====

To create a new cash **deposit**, go to the menu *Invoicing > Accounting > Miscellaneous > Cash Deposits* and click on *Create*: select the currency, the cash box from which you will take the cash out and the bank journal corresponding to the bank account on which you want to deposit the cash. Then create/edit lines to enter the quantity for each kind of bank note and coin rolls. Then, you can print a PDF report designed to be a kind of delivery report for the cash. Upon validation, Odoo will generate a journal entry in the cash journal that:

* credits the cash account,
* debits the inter-banks transfer account.

The process is very similar when **ordering** cash but you have to use another menu entry: menu *Invoicing > Accounting > Miscellaneous > Cash Orders*. Select the currency, the cash box that will receive the cash and the bank account from which the bank will take the money. Create/edit lines to enter the details of your order (bank notes, coin rolls). Then, you can confirm the order and print a PDF report designed to be sent to your bank as a cash order. Eventually, when the bank delivers the cash to you, you should validate the cash order and Odoo will generate a journal entry in the cash journal that:

* debits the cash account,
* credits the inter-banks transfer account.
