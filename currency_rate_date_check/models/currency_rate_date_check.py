# Here are some explainations about the design of this module.
# In odoo/odoo/addons/base/res/res_currency.py :
# compute() -> _get_conversion_rate()
# -> _current_rate() -> _get_current_rate()
# The date used for the rate is the one in the self.env.context

# Which one of the 3 functions should we inherit ? Good question...
# It's probably better to inherit the lowest level function,
# i.e. _get_current_rate()
# Advantage : by inheriting the lowest level function,
# we can be sure that the check
# always apply, even for scenarios where we
# read the field "rate" of the obj currency
# => that's the solution I implement in the code below

        # too often, for example it would raise entering the
