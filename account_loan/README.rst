This module extends the functionality of accounting to support loans.
It will create automatically moves or invoices for loans.
Moreover, you can check the pending amount to be paid and reduce the debt.

It currently supports two kinds of debts:

* Loans: a standard debt with banks, that only creates account moves.
   Loan types info:
   `APR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annual_percentage_rate>`_,
   `EAR <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effective_interest_rate>`_,
   `Real Rate <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real_interest_rate>`_.
* Leases: a debt with a bank where purchase invoices are necessary
