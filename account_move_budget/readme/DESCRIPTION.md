This module allows to define accounting budgets.

These budgets can then be used in MIS Builder reports, as an alternate
source.

The difference between the MIS Builder Budget and this module is that
this module defines budgets irrespective of the MIS Builder Template.
The budget is thus agnostic of the reporting format.

For example, the budgeted data can be used in a general Profit & Loss
report and at the same time can be used in a department or project
expenses report.
