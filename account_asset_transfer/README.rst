This module allow transferring assets under construction (AUC) to normal assets.

AUC is Asset under construction where some assets are in construction phase and
cost needs to be captured for the time being. Once asset is fully completed then
cost would be transferred to final asset

* If the asset don't have journal entries, asset transfer will use account settings from the asset/asset profile instead.
