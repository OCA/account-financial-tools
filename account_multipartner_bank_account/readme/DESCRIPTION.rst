This module replaces the unique bank account number SQL constraint with
a Python constraint and allows to override that constraint. Overriding
the constraint allows creating multiple bank accounts with the same bank
account number.

This is useful when two partners have the same bank account number, eg.
they are using the same factoring service or they are two companies
using the same bank account.
