Go to Partner -> Bank Accounts -> Bank Account and select "Override
Uniqueness". After selecting this, you can create another bank account
with the same bank account number for a different partner.

Note that after applying the override to one or more bank accounts, you
will see warning(s) in the log next time when upgrading the module.
