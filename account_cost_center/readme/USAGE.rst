This module is relevant when you are creating sales invoices and using analytic accounting.

Start using cost centers by defining the cost centers. Be aware that Analytic Accounting
must be activated on the user for the following menu option.
Use the menu in the accounting module:

    **Configuration > Analytics accounting > Cost centers**
